        "First, I was surprised that the average salary for mechanical engineers was so low in 2023, only about $64,000. Many of these jobs don’t require work experience from a related field. Whenever I hear about getting a job, I always hear that employers only hire people with many years of work experience. Perhaps these jobs technically don’t need prior experience, but the standards are higher because of how competitive the job market is. Despite not needing work experience in a related occupation, almost none of these jobs offer on-the-job training. I assume it’s because a degree is required, but it gives me the impression that people should be able to handle the job well enough right at the start, which I do not believe is true.\n",
